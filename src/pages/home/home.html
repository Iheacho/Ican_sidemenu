      <p><strong>I</strong>t gives me immense pleasure to heartily welcome all our distinguished
        delegates to the 47th Annual Accountants Conference of the Institute of
        Chartered Accountants taking place at the International Conference Centre
        Abuja, on Monday to Friday, 16 - 20 October 2017, under the theme “Nigeria
        First: Accountancy, Nation Building and the Future”.</p>
      <p>This landmark event prides itself as the largest congregation of chartered
        accountants in Africa. Last year, about 4,000 delegates comprising Chartered
        Accountants in public practice, commerce and industry, public sector, the
        academia as well as leaders of professional accounting organisations from
        across the West African sub-region attended the conference.</p>
      <p>Every year, the ICAN Annual Accountants’ Conference has traditionally
        combined great professional content with a tremendous opportunity to learn,
        exchange views, play, compete, relax, laugh and enjoy the camaraderie of
        friends and professional colleagues. This year’s conference has been
        designed not only to educate, enrich, excite, recharge and reinvigorate
        delegates but also to exceedingly supersede the usual high standards that
        our members have come to expect. I hope you enjoy every minute of it!</p>
      <p>An outstanding gallery of world-class and sought after speakers will
        participate and share with us the most significant advances in our profession.
        Whatever sessions you choose to attend, they all seek to expand the
        profession’s horizons by empowering delegates with the latest knowledge
        and tools to become future relevant Chartered Accountants, while upholding
        the core principles of integrity, accountability and trust which have made our
        profession invaluable and indispensable.</p>

      <p>Of course I must thank each of our world-class speakers. All of them experts
        and leaders in their fields for graciously agreeing to share their wisdom and
        experience with us, and for this, we are eternally grateful.</p>
      <p>One unique feature of this year’s conference is its focus on the role of
        Chartered Accountants in Nation Building leveraging on our public interest
        mandate. The Institute will be unveiling and launching of the ICAN
        Accountability Index which is the first of its kind mechanism for assessing
        public finance management and public governance practices of Nigerian
        public sector institutions including the Executive (Federal, State and Local
        Governments), the Legislature and the Judiciary.</p>

      <p>The Institute is very proud of its role and that of other stakeholders in the
        development of this index, which we believe is a relevant, innovative and
        timely contribution to Accountability, Public Finance Management and
        Governance practices in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>We have a great team of members and staff on the Annual Accountants
        Conference Committee working tirelessly to make this year’s conference a
        truly memorable event. I hope that you will join me in expressing thanks to
        them over the next few days, wherever you meet them, for their time,
        outstanding ideas, dedication and selfless service committed towards
        organising this conference.</p>
      <p>Finally, I thank all our distinguished delegates for choosing to attend and
        participate at the 47th Annual Accountants’ Conference and happily look
        forward to meeting you.</p><br><br>
      <p>GOD BLESS YOU</p>
